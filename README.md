This is one of my first C# Windows Forms App's, in this case a little tool wich is designed to help you make changes to specific ase settings like:
- Ini's
- Canva's
- Skin Textures
- Disc / Recon Feature
- Made ez gamma change

The programm is old and has hardcoded paths, the default game files are on C drive so you might have to change them for you to be working

maybe future updates
